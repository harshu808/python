# We create an empty list called queue to represent our queue.

# We enqueue (add) items to the queue using the append() method. The items are added to the end of the list, representing the back of the queue.

# We dequeue (remove) an item from the queue using the pop(0) method. The item removed is the first one that was enqueued, representing the front of the queue.

# After dequeuing an item, we enqueue another item to the queue.

# Finally, we print the current state of the queue.

# We import the re module, which provides functions for working with regular expressions.

# We define a text variable that contains sample text with email addresses.

# We define a regular expression pattern (pattern) for matching email addresses. This pattern is a common one for simple email address validation.

# We use re.finditer(pattern, text) to find all matches of the pattern in the text. re.finditer returns an iterable containing match objects.

# We loop through the match objects and print each email address found.

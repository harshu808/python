# We define a simple class Rectangle with attributes width and height.
# The class includes two instance methods, area and perimeter, which perform calculations based on the attributes.
# We create an instance of the Rectangle class called rectangle.
# We access the method objects for the area and perimeter methods using the instance object and store them in variables.
# We call the method objects with empty parentheses () to execute the methods and calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

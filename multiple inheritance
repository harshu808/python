# We define two base classes, A and B, each with their own methods.
# We define a subclass C that inherits from both A and B. This allows instances of C to access methods from both A and B.
# We create an instance of class C called obj.
# We access methods from both base classes A and B using obj.method_A() and obj.method_B().
# We also access the method from class C using obj.method_C().

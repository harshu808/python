# We import the sys module, which provides access to command-line arguments through the sys.argv list.

# We use len(sys.argv) to determine the total number of command-line arguments, including the script name. The script name is always the first element in the sys.argv list.

# We print the script name (sys.argv[0]) to display the name of the script itself.

# We print the total number of arguments (num_args) to show how many arguments were provided.

# We iterate through the command-line arguments starting from the second element (sys.argv[1:]) and print each argument with its corresponding index.

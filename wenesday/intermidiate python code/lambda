# We have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with keys 'title', 'author', and 'price'.

# We use the sorted function to sort the list of dictionaries based on the 'price' key. To achieve this, we pass a lambda expression as the key argument to sorted. The lambda expression extracts the 'price' value from each dictionary for comparison during sorting.

# The resulting sorted_books list contains the dictionaries sorted by the 'price' key in ascending order.

# We then print the sorted list of dictionaries, displaying the book title, author, and price for each book.

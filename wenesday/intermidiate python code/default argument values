# We define a function print_student_info that takes four parameters: name, age, major, and enrolled. major and enrolled have default values set.

# We provide a docstring for the function to describe its purpose and parameters.

# We test the function with three different scenarios:

# Student Alice has a specified major, and the default value for enrolled is used.
# Student Bob is not currently enrolled, and the default value for major is used.
# Student Charlie has both major and enrolled values using the defaults.
# By providing default argument values for major and enrolled, we make the function more flexible and user-friendly. Users can choose to provide values for these parameters or rely on the defaults when calling the function.

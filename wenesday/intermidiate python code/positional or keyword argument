# We define a function calculate_payment that takes hours_worked as a required positional argument, hourly_rate as a keyword argument with a default value, bonus_args as additional positional arguments collected into a tuple, deductions as a keyword argument with a default value, and extra_kwargs to capture any additional keyword arguments.

# We provide a docstring for the function to describe its purpose and parameters.

# We test the function with two different scenarios:

# Employee 1 worked 40 hours at an hourly rate of $20.0, had $50 in deductions, and received bonuses of $100 and $200.
# Employee 2 worked 30 hours at an hourly rate of $10.0, had $20 in deductions, and received bonuses of $25 and $30. We also specify additional keyword argument tax.
# We calculate the payments for the employees using the function, considering the various arguments and bonuses.

# We print the calculated payments and process any extra keyword arguments provided.

# We define a function calculate_payment that takes hours_worked as a positional-only parameter (indicated by the / in the parameter list), hourly_rate as a regular parameter with a default value, bonus_args as additional positional arguments collected into a tuple, deductions as a keyword argument with a default value, and extra_kwargs to capture any additional keyword arguments.

# We provide a docstring for the function to describe its purpose and parameters.

# We test the function with two different scenarios, similar to the previous example, using both positional and keyword arguments.

# We calculate the payments for the employees using the function, considering the various arguments and bonuses.

# We print the calculated payments and process any extra keyword arguments provided.

# We define a function calculate_payment that takes hours_worked as a positional parameter, hourly_rate and deductions as keyword-only parameters (indicated by * in the parameter list), and extra_kwargs to capture any additional keyword arguments.

# We provide a docstring for the function to describe its purpose and parameters.

# We test the function with two different scenarios:

# Employee 1 worked 40 hours at an hourly rate of $20.0, had $50 in deductions, and also specified the tax keyword argument.
# Employee 2 worked 30 hours at an hourly rate of $10.0, had $20 in deductions, and specified both the tax and bonus keyword arguments.
# We calculate the payments for the employees using the function, considering the various keyword-only arguments and any additional keyword arguments provided.

# We print the calculated payments and process any extra keyword arguments provided.

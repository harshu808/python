# We define a custom exception class CustomException using pass to indicate that we'll implement its behavior later.

# The complex_algorithm function uses pass as a placeholder for future implementation when the data is empty.

# We raise a CustomException and handle it using pass within a try-except block.

# In the MyClass class, we define methods with pass as placeholders for future implementation.

# We use pass in a loop to iterate without executing any code.

# The empty_function is defined with pass, indicating that it is intentionally empty.

# Finally, we use pass within a conditional block as a placeholder for future code.

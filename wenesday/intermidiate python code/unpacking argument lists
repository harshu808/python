# We define a function calculate_total_cost that accepts a base price, a tax rate, variable-length positional arguments *item_prices, and variable-length keyword arguments **item_discounts.

# We provide a docstring for the function to describe its purpose and parameters.

# We test the function by creating a list of item prices (item_prices), a dictionary of item discounts (item_discounts), and then passing them to the function by unpacking the lists and dictionaries.

# Inside the function, we calculate the subtotal of item prices, the total discount, the total tax, and the total cost.

# We use the * and ** syntax when calling the function to unpack the item prices and discounts.

# Finally, we print the calculated total cost, which includes tax and discounts.

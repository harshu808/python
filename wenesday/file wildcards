# We import the glob module, which provides a function called glob.glob() for working with file wildcards.

# We use glob.glob("*.txt") to search for all files in the current directory with a .txt extension. The "*.txt" is a wildcard pattern that matches any file with a .txt extension.

# The result is a list of filenames that match the pattern, which we store in the text_files variable.

# We then iterate over the list of matching files and print each filename.

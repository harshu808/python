# We import the gzip module, which provides functions for GZIP compression and decompression.

# We define the data_to_compress variable with the data you want to compress. In this example, we use a simple byte string.

# We use gzip.compress(data_to_compress) to compress the data.

# We use gzip.decompress(compressed_data) to decompress the compressed data.

# We verify that the decompressed data matches the original data to ensure that compression and decompression were successful.

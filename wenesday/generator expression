# We create a generator expression (x**2 for x in range(1, 6)) that generates the squares of numbers from 1 to 5. The for loop hasn't started iterating yet, so no values have been generated at this point.

# We then use a for loop to iterate over the generator. As we iterate, each value is generated one at a time, and the square of the current number is printed.

# We import the requests library, which allows us to send HTTP requests and receive responses.

# We define the url variable with the URL of the website you want to access (in this case, "https://www.example.com").

# Inside a try block, we send a GET request to the specified URL using requests.get(url).

# We check if the request was successful by examining the HTTP status code. A status code of 200 indicates success.

# If the request was successful, we print the content of the website using response.text.

# If the request fails or encounters an exception (e.g., network issues or invalid URL), we catch the requests.exceptions.RequestException and print an error message.

It passes the name and age parameters to the constructor of the Person class to initialize the attributes inherited from Person. This is a common practice when you want to reuse the initialization logic of the parent class.

# Class 'Person':

# It serves as the base class with an __init__ method to initialize name and age.
# It defines an introduce method to introduce a person.
# Inheritance:

# 'Student' and 'Teacher' classes inherit from the 'Person' class.
# They extend the base class by adding specific attributes and methods.
# Composition:

# The 'School' class is composed of students and teachers.
# It has methods to add students and teachers, as well as to display the lists of students and teachers.
# Main Program:

# Instances of 'Student' and 'Teacher' classes are created.
# An instance of the 'School' class is created.
# Students and teachers are added to the school.
# Various methods are called to introduce, study, and teach.
# The lists of students and teachers in the school are displayed.

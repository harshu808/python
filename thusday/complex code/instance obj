# 'Student' Class:

# We define the 'Student' class with class variables (student_count) and instance variables (name, age, student_id).
# The class also has an instance method (introduce) to introduce a student.
# Instance Objects:

# We create three instances (student1, student2, student3) of the 'Student' class.
# Each instance represents a different student with unique attributes.
# Accessing Instance Variables and Methods:

# We access instance variables (name, age, student_id) and call the introduce method for each student instance.
# Class Variable 'student_count':

# We demonstrate how to access the class variable student_count to count the number of students created.

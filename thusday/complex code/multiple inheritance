# Base Classes:

# We define three base classes: 'Animal,' 'Flyable,' and 'Swimmable.'
# Each base class has one or more methods relevant to its purpose.
# Class 'Bird' (Multiple Inheritance from 'Animal' and 'Flyable'):

# We create the 'Bird' class that inherits from both 'Animal' and 'Flyable.'
# 'Bird' overrides the 'speak' and 'fly' methods.
# Class 'Fish' (Multiple Inheritance from 'Animal' and 'Swimmable'):

# We create the 'Fish' class that inherits from both 'Animal' and 'Swimmable.'
# 'Fish' overrides the 'speak' and 'swim' methods.
# Class 'Duck' (Multiple Inheritance from 'Bird' and 'Fish'):

# We create the 'Duck' class that inherits from both 'Bird' and 'Fish.'
# 'Duck' does not override any methods but inherits them from the base classes.
# Main Program:

# We create an instance of 'Duck' named 'donald_duck.'
# We demonstrate multiple inheritance by calling methods from different base classes.

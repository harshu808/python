# We define a function called greet that takes three arguments: name, age, and city. This function constructs a greeting message using these arguments.

# We create a list called person_info that contains three values: name, age, and city.

# We call the greet function and use the * operator to unpack the person_info list and pass its elements as separate arguments to the function.

# The function greet receives the unpacked arguments and constructs the greeting message.

# We print the result, which will display the greeting message with the values from the person_info list.

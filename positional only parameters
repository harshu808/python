# We define a function called calculate_product with two positional-only parameters (x and y) indicated by the / symbol. This means you can only pass values for x and y by their positions, not by using keyword arguments.

# Inside the function, we calculate the product of x and y.

# We call the calculate_product function using positional arguments for x and y.

# We also have a commented-out line that attempts to call the function using keyword arguments (x=5 and y=3). Uncommenting this line would result in a TypeError because keyword arguments are not allowed for positional-only parameters.

# When you run this code, it will correctly calculate and print the product of 5 and 3 using positional arguments.

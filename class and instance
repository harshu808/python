# We define a class Student with a class variable student_count to keep track of the number of students. Class variables are shared among all instances of the class.
# The class has an __init__ method that initializes instance variables name and age for each student. Instance variables are specific to each instance.
# Inside the __init__ method, we increment the class variable student_count to count the number of students created.
# The display_info method prints information about the student, including their name, age, and the total number of students.

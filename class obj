# We define a simple class Dog with a constructor (__init__) method that initializes instance attributes name and breed.
# The class also includes an instance method bark that returns a string indicating the dog's bark.
# We create two instances (dog1 and dog2) of the Dog class with different names and breeds.
# We access the attributes name and breed, as well as call the bark method on each object.

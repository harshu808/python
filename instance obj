# We define a simple class Student with a constructor (__init__) method that initializes instance attributes name, age, and grade.
# The class includes an instance method display_info that prints the student's information.
# We create two instance objects (student1 and student2) of the Student class with different attributes.
# We call the display_info method on each object to display their information.
